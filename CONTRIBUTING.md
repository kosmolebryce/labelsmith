2. **Clone your fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine for development.

## Current Focus Areas

We are currently focusing on:

1. Expanding and improving the core functionality of the `shyft` module.
2. Developing the `utils.metrics` module.
3. Enhancing documentation, especially user guides and API references.
4. Establishing a testing framework and beginning to build our test suite.

Contributions in these areas are particularly welcome, but we're open to all improvements!

## Code Quality

While we haven't yet established a formal testing suite, we strive for high-quality code. Please ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows Python best practices. As we grow, we plan to implement more formal quality assurance processes, including a comprehensive test suite.
