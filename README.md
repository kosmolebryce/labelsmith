We welcome early adopters and greatly appreciate your feedback. However, please exercise caution when implementing in production environments.

## Project Description

**Labelsmith** is an open-source Python project designed to streamline data annotators' workflows. Our goal is to create a robust, extensible toolkit that empowers data annotators to maximize their productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction while contributing to the advancement of AI and machine learning projects.

Labelsmith is a project of LabelSTREAM (Label Syndicate for Transparency, Responsibility, and Ethicality in Algorithmic Management), an organization committed to improving the landscape of data annotation and algorithmic management.

### Current Features

The `labelsmith` package currently offers the following core modules:

1. **`shyft`**: A comprehensive shift-logging application built on the `tkinter` GUI framework. Key features include:
   
   - Automatic shift duration tracking with a configurable, always-on-top timer
   - Task metadata recording and note-taking interface
   - Local data persistence for shift entries and tasking history
   - Full CRUD operations for shift records
   - Autolog functionality for streamlined task logging

2. **`utils`**: A collection of utility scripts aimed at optimizing annotator workflows:
   - `utils.income`: Includes the `simulate` function for modeling earnings scenarios based on various workload parameters
   - `utils.metrics`: Provides productivity and earnings analysis tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install labelsmith
```

We recommend installing in a virtual environment for testing purposes.

## Roadmap

1. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Expand test coverage**
2. Enhance productivity visualization tools
3. Implement tabbed interface for task history review
4. Develop plugin system for custom annotator tools
5. Expand and improve core functionality of the `shyft` module
6. Create comprehensive documentation and API reference
